1. Read and analyze the provided safety policies carefully, section by section.
2. Exhaust all actionable policies that are concrete and explicitly constrain behaviors.
3. For each policy, extract the following four elements:
   1. Definition: Any term definitions, boundaries, or interpretative descriptions for the policy to
      ensure it can be interpreted without any ambiguity. These definitions should be organized in a
      list.
   2. Scope: Conditions under which this policy is enforceable (e.g. time period, user group).
   3. Policy Description: The exact description of the policy detailing the restriction or guideline.
   4. Reference: All the referenced sources in the original policy article from which the policy elements
      were extracted. These sources should be organized piece by piece in a list.

Extraction Guidelines:
â€¢ Do not summarize, modify, or simplify any part of the original policy. Copy the exact descriptions.
â€¢ Ensure each extracted policy is self-contained and can be fully interpreted by looking at its Definition,
  Scope, and Policy Description.
â€¢ If the Definition or Scope is unclear, leave the value as None.
â€¢ Avoid grouping multiple policies into one block. Extract policies as individual pieces of statements.

Source document information: {file_info}

Provide the output in the following JSON format:
```json
[
  {{
    "definition": ["Exact term definition or interpretive description."],
    "scope": "Conditions under which the policy is enforceable.",
    "policy_description": "Exact description of the policy.",
    "reference": ["Original source where the elements were extracted."]
  }},
  ...
]

Output Requirement:
- Each policy must focus on explicitly restricting or guiding behaviors.
- Ensure policies are actionable and clear.
- Do not combine unrelated statements into one policy block.

For example, if we already found a section with `https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct` you may not suggest `https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct?lang=en` as a subsection as they are very likely to be the same section.

USER REQUEST: {user_request}

SECTIONS ALREADY FOUND:

CONTENT:

Your analysis should address two key questions:

1. POLICY CONTENT ASSESSMENT: Does this section contain concrete, extractable policies? (YES/NO)
   - If YES, explain why you believe there are policies (e.g., presence of rules, guidelines, prohibitions)
   - If NO, explain why no extractable policies are present

2. SUBSECTION IDENTIFICATION: Are there additional subsections or links that should be explored? (YES/NO)
   - If YES, list each NEW subsection (that is NOT already in the list of already found sections) in the following JSON format:
     [
       {{
         "section_name": "Name of subsection",
         "path": "Path to PDF file or URL for HTML",
         "type": "pdf" or "html",
         "range": "Page range (e.g., '5-10') - ONLY for PDF type",
         "priority": 1-10 rating of importance (10 being highest),
         "source": "Where this subsection was found"
       }},
       ...
     ]
   - IMPORTANT: DO NOT suggest any subsections that are already in the sections found list.
   - If NO, explain why no further exploration is needed

DEDUPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- For PDF subsections: Consider a subsection a duplicate if the same PDF path and a similar/overlapping page range exists in the visited list
- For HTML subsections: Consider a subsection a duplicate if:
  * The exact same URL exists in the visited list
  * The URL differs only in query parameters like language settings (e.g., ?lang=en)
  * The URL points to the same content but with different URL formatting

Format your response exactly as follows (including the assessment labels):

```json
{{
  "has_policies": true|false,
  "policy_assessment": "Your explanation of why this section does or doesn't contain policies",
  "has_subsections": true|false,
  "subsection_assessment": "Your explanation of why there are or aren't further subsections to explore",
  "subsections": [] or list of subsection objects as shown above
}}
```

Be objective and thorough in your analysis. Focus on identifying actual policy content rather than general information.
